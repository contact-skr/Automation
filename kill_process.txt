Here's how to use this script:

Save the script to a file, for example, kill_processes.sh.
Make the script executable: chmod +x kill_processes.sh
Run the script with a pattern to match the processes you want to kill: ./kill_processes.sh "python script.py"
This script does the following:

It defines a function kill_processes that takes a pattern to match and an optional signal (defaulting to SIGTERM).
It uses pgrep -f to find processes matching the given pattern.
If processes are found, it displays the PIDs and kills each process using the specified signal.
The main part of the script checks for command-line arguments and calls the kill_processes function.
You can also specify a different signal, like SIGKILL:
./kill_processes.sh "python script.py" KILL

This script is safer than using ps -ef | grep and then killing processes manually because:

It uses pgrep, which is designed for finding processes and avoids issues with grep matching itself.
It allows you to review the PIDs before killing them.
It's more efficient and less error-prone than manual killing.
Remember to use this script cautiously, as killing processes can have unintended consequences if you're not careful with the pattern matching.
